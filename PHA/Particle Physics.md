| **Isotopes:** Atoms with same protons but different neutrons. Becomes unstable due to factors like nucleus size, proton deficiency/richness, or excess energy. |
| **Ionization:** Atom loses/gains electron, becoming charged. Occurs when absorbed energy > ionization energy.                                                  |
| **Excitation:** Electron gains energy to move to higher level.                                                                                                 |

| **Annihilation**: Particle meets antiparticle, producing gamma photons.                                                                                        |
| **Hadrons:** Made of quarks (e.g., protons/neutrons). Classes are Baryons/Antibaryons and Mesons.                                                              |
| **Leptons:** Fundamental particles (e.g., electrons/muons). **Protons:** Stable baryon, eventual decay destination for all baryons.                                |
| **Mesons:** Decay into leptons via weak interaction.                                                                                                           |
| **Strange Particles**: Created in pairs, conserve strangeness in SNI.                                                                                          |
| **Threshold Frequency:** Minimum frequency for photoelectrons to be emitted in photoelectric effect.                                                           |
| **Work Function:** Minimum energy to remove electron from metal surface.                                                                                       |

| **Photoelectric Effect:** Emission of photoelectrons from metal due to light above a threshold frequency.                                                      |     


# Forces:
- **Strong Nuclear Force:** Binds nucleons, range of 3fm, mediated by gluons.
- **Weak Nuclear Force:** Responsible for particle decay, mediated by W-bozon.
- **Electromagnetic Force:** Operates via virtual photons between charged particles.

# Ionization and Excitation in Fluorescent Tube:
Electrons collide with mercury atoms, ionizing them. Free electrons excite more mercury atoms, releasing UV photons. Phosphor coating absorbs UV photons (causing excitation), emitting visible light (through de-excitation).
# Photon Model vs. Wave Theory:
Photoelectric effect supports photon nature of EM waves. Electron diffraction suggests particles have wave properties.
