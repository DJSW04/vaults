2. What 2 things does a capacitor store?
	Charge and Energy
3. When you charge up a capacitor, what happens to:
	1. The current flowing into it
		 Decreases with time
	1. The voltage across it
		 increases with time
	1. The amount of charge on the plates
		 increase to a maximum $Q<eV$

**What happens during charging?**
- During charging, electrons are forced onto one parallel plate from the other
- Which is going to require more energy, pushing on the first electrons or the final electron? - last
- Energy is stored as Electric Potential Energy
- Energy stored = work done in moving the charge = Voltage $\times$ charge ($E=vQ$)
