# Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction
$$\epsilon=\frac{-N\triangle\phi}{\triangle t}$$
**The induced EMF, $\epsilon$ in a coil with $N$ turns is equal to the rate of change of flux linkage through the coil. $\frac{\triangle\phi}{\triangle t}$**
>The minus sign represents the fact that the induced emf acts in such a direction as to oppose the change that causes it *([[2023-12-11 Lenz's Law]])*.
