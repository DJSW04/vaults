[[Magnetic Fields]]

>An emf is induced whenever a conductor cuts through lines of flux. If that conductor forms part of a complete circuit, a current will flow in the circuit due to the induced emf.

**Lenzâ€™s Law:** The direction of the induced current is always such as to oppose the change that causes the current.

>An eddy current is the current which is induced in little swirls ("eddies") on a large conductor (picture a sheet of copper). If a large conductive metal plate is moved into or out of a magnetic field which intersects perpendicularly to the sheet, the magnetic field will induce small "rings" of current which will actually create internal magnetic fields opposing the change.
