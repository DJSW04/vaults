| **NEWTONS FIRST LAW:** if there is no resultant force, an object will carry on in the same direction with the same speed or continue to be at rest |
| **NEWTONS SECOND LAW:** if there is a resultant force, an object will continue to accelerate in the direction of that force.                       |
| **NEWTONS THIRD LAW:** if object A exerts a force on object B, object B will exert an equal and opposite force on A.                               |
| **ELASTIC COLLISION:** momentum and kinetic energy is conserved.                                                                                                                                                   |
