# Electromagnetic induction
---
- [ ] *Simple experimental phenomena.* 
- [ ] *Faraday’s and Lenz’s laws.*
- [ ] *Magnitude of induced emf = rate of change of flux linkage:* $$$\epsilon = N\frac{\triangle\phi}{\triangle t}$$
- [ ] *Applications such as a straight conductor moving in a magnetic field.*
- [ ] *emf induced in a coil rotating uniformly in a magnetic field:* $$\epsilon=BAN\omega \sin {wt}$$
