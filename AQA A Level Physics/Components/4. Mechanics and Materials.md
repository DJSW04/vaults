| **NEWTONS FIRST LAW:** if there is no resultant force, an object will carry on in the same direction with the same speed or continue to be at rest |
| **NEWTONS SECOND LAW:** if there is a resultant force, an object will continue to accelerate in the direction of that force.                       |
| **NEWTONS THIRD LAW:** if object A exerts a force on object B, object B will exert an equal and opposite force on A.                               |
| **ELASTIC COLLISION:** momentum and kinetic energy is conserved.                                                                                                                                                   |

| **ELASTIC LIMIT:** point beyond which the spring is permanently stretched.    |
| **PLASTIC:** material does not return to original size after being stretched. |
| **ELASTIC:** material returns to original size after being stretched.         |
| **BRITTLE:** snaps without any noticeable yield.                              |
| **STRONG:** greater UTS                                                       |
| **WEAK:** low UTS                                                             |
| **STIFF:** large force required to extend material by a unit length.          |
| **DENSE:** high mass-to-volume ratio.                                         |
| **FLEXIBLE:** small force required to extend material by a unit length.       |
| **MALLEABLE:** can be hammered into sheets                                                                          |
