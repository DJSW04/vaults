**OHMIC CONDUCTOR:** component where I is proportional to V provided R (along with physical conditions) are kept constant.

>**Thermistor:** non-ohmic, resistance changes with temperature (temperature increase current increase, resistance decrease).

**SUPERCONDUCTOR:** conductor which has 0 resistance at or below the critical temperature.
- Produce high magnetic field strength
- less energy loss

>**ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE:** energy transferred by a cell per coulomb of charge that passes through it.
