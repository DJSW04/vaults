	- vertex/node
	- edge/arc
	- undirected graph
	- directed graph.
- [ ] *Know how an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list may be used to represent a graph.*
- [ ] *Be able to compare the use of adjacency matrices and adjacency lists.*

**Graphs:** Dynamic data structure for navigation, data transmission, etc.
- Graphs consist of vertex/nodes connected by edges/arc
- Edges > Vertex = dense
- Vertex > Edge = sparse
**Weighted Graph:** each edge/arc has a value
**Undirected Graph:** All edges are bidirectional
**Directed:** Some edges are directional
## **Adjacency Matrix vs. Adjacency List:**
**Matrix:** Quick, simple edge management, but wastes memory for sparse graphs.
**List:** Space-efficient, especially for sparse graphs.
