[[Algorithms Overview]]
# Linear Search
---
- [ ] *Know and be able to trace and analyse the complexity of the linear search algorithm.*
---
- $O(n)$
- Sequentially checks each item until the target is found.
- If the end is reached, the target is not in set.
# [[Binary Search Algorithm|Binary Search]]
---
- [ ] *Know and be able to trace and analyse the time complexity of the binary search algorithm.*
---
- $O(\log (n))$
- Requires sorted data.
- Compare the middle element with the target value.
- Adjusts search area based on comparison.
# Binary Tree Search
---
- [ ] *Be able to trace and analyse the time complexity of the binary tree search algorithm.*
---
**Binary Tree Search:** Similar to binary search, conducted on a binary tree.
