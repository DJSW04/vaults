	• **in-order**
 - [ ] *Be able to describe uses of tree-traversal algorithms*

**Pre-Order:** Visit root, Traverse left sub-tree, Traverse right sub-tree
- Use: Copying a tree (can be performed on any tree).
**In-Order:** Traverse left sub-tree, Visit the root, Traverse right sub-tree
- Use: Outputs contents of a binary tree in ascending order.
**Post-Order:** Traverse left sub-tree, Traverse right sub-tree, Visit root
- Use: Converts an expression tree to postfix notation and empties the tree.
