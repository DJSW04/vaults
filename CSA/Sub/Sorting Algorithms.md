# Bubble Sort
---
- [ ] Know and be able to trace and analyse the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm
---
- $O(n^2)$
- Iteratively compares and swaps adjacent elements.

- [ ] Be able to trace and analyse the time complexity of the merge sort algorithm.
---
- $O(n\log(n))$
- Divides unsorted lists into sub-lists and recursively merges them.
