[[Data Structures Overview]]

---
- [ ] *Know that a tree is a connected, undirected graph with no cycles.*
- [ ] *Know that a rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the root.Â A rooted tree has parent-child relationships between nodes. The root is the only node with no parent and all other nodes are descendants of the root.*
- [ ] *Know that a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has at most two children.*
- [ ] *Be familiar with typical uses for rooted trees.*

**Trees:** Connected, undirected, no cycles.
**Binary Trees:**
- Dynamic structure, efficient sorting/searching/retrieval.
- Nodes can have 0/1/2 branches, with left/right pointers.
