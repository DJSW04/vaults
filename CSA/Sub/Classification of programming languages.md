[[Computer Systems Overview]]
# Classification of programming languages
>Programs in low-level languages are specific to the type of processor they are written for and directly affect the computerâ€™s processor.

There are two categories of low-level language: machine code and assembly language:

Machine code, using only binary digits, is challenging for humans to understand. Despite its error-prone nature, it provides powerful control over a computer's processor, making it beneficial for tasks like embedded systems and real-time applications that require speedy execution.

Assembly language, created to simplify computer program development, employs mnemonics like ADD and MOV instead of machine code's binary instructions. This results in more concise and less error-prone code, with a direct 1-to-1 correlation between assembly language and machine code instructions.

*High-level languages Ex. C#, Java, Pascal, Python, and VB

High-level languages, unlike low-level ones, are platform-independent but require compilation or interpretation to machine code before execution. They use English instructions and mathematical symbols, making them more human-friendly and easier to debug. Built-in functions save programming time, and features like named variables enhance debuggability. Imperative high-level languages dictate task completion instructions, contrasting with declarative programming.
