- [ ] Describe the role of sockets in the TCP/IP stack.
- [ ] Be familiar with the role of MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
- [ ] Explain what the well-known ports and client ports are used for and the differences between them.

# Standard application layer protocols
---
- [ ] **Be familiar with the following protocols:** 
	    ● FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
	    ● HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
	    ● HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
	    ● POP3 (Post Office Protocol (v3))
	    ● SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
	    ● SSH (Secure Shell).
- [ ] Be familiar with FTP client software and an FTP server, with regard to transferring files using anonymous and non-anonymous access.
- [ ] Be familiar with how SSH is used for remote management.
- [ ] Know how an SSH client is used to make a TCP connection to a remote port for the purpose of sending commands to this port using application level protocols such as GET for HTTP, SMTP commands for sending email and POP3 for retrieving email.
- [ ] Be familiar with using SSH to log in securely to a remote computer and execute commands.
- [ ] Explain the role of an email server in retrieving and sending email.
- [ ] Explain the role of a web server in serving up web pages in text form.
- [ ] Understand the role of a web browser in retrieving web pages and web page resources and rendering these accordingly.
---

# IP address structure
---
- [ ] Know that an IP address is split into a network identifier part and a host identifier part.
---

# Subnet masking
---
- [ ] Know that networks can be divided into subnets and know how a subnet mask is used to identify the network identifier part of the IP address.
---

# IP standards
---
- [ ] Know that there are currently two standards of IP address, v4 and v6.
- [ ] Know why v6 was introduced.
---

# Public and private IP addresses
---
- [ ] Distinguish between routable and non-routable IP addresses.
---

# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
---
- [ ] Understand the purpose and function of the DHCP system.
---

# Network Address Translation (NAT)
---
- [ ] Explain the basic concept of NAT and why it is used.
---

# Port forwarding
---
- [ ] Explain the basic concept of port forwarding and why it is used.
---

# Client server model
---
- [ ] Be familiar with the client server model.
- [ ] Be familiar with the Websocket protocol and know why it is used and where it is used.
- [ ] **Be familiar with the principles of Web CRUD Applications and REST:**
      ● CRUD is an acronym for: C – Create R – Retrieve U – Update D – Delete.
      ● REST enables CRUD to be mapped to database functions (SQL) as follows:
          GET → SELECT
          POST → INSERT
          DELETE → DELETE
          PUT → UPDATE
- [ ] Compare JSON (Java script object notation) with XML.

# Thin- versus thick-client computing
---
- [ ] Compare and contrast thin-client computing with thick-client computing.
