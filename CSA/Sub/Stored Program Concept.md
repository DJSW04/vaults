# The meaning of the stored program concept
---
- [ ] *Be able to describe the stored program concept: machine code instructions stored in main memory are fetched and executed serially by a processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations.*

>â€œserially fetching and executing machine code instructions stored in main memory by a processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations".

* Allows one set of instructions to be switched out for another
* Allows modern computers to run numerous different applications
* The contents of a memory location to be interpreted either as instructions or data
* This can be exploited in hacks that work by placing instructions in the position of data in order to make the computer execute malicious code
* The universal Turing machine is seen as an early example of the stored program concept

**Computers that use the stored program concept can be based on one of two different architectures:** [[Von Neumann and Harvard architectures]]
