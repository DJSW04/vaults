# Simple Graph-Traversal Algorithms
 --- 
 - [ ] Be able to trace breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms and describe typical applications of both.
--- 
**Depth-First:** Fully explores a branch before backtracking. Used for maze navigation and connected graphs.
**Breadth-First:** Fully explores a node before moving to the next. Used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
