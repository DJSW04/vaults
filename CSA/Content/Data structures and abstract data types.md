>DATA STRUCTURES organise/store data to be accessed/modified

Data structures are used by computers as the containers within which information is stored. Different data structures exist and some are better suited to different types of data than others.
# Single- and multi-dimensional arrays
---
- [ ] *Use arrays (or equivalent) in the design of solutions to simple problems.*
---
**Arrays:** Stores finite data of the same datatype in a single identifier.
# Fields, records and files
---
- [ ] *Be able to read/write from/to a text file.*
- [ ] *Be able to read/write data from/to a binary (non-text) file.*
---
**Records:** Collection of related fields, which are variables.
**Text/Binary Files:** Organised collection of records.
**Record Structure Process:** define record, declare variable/array, assign/retrieve data from record.

- [ ] *Be familiar with the concept and uses of a:*
	- queue
	- stack
	- graph
	- tree
	- hash table
	- dictionary
	- vector
- [ ] *Be able to distinguish between static and dynamic structures and compare their uses, as well as explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each.*
- [ ] *Describe the creation and maintenance of data within:*
	- queues (linear, circular, priority)
	- stacks
	- hash tables.

**Static:** Fixed size, memory immutable, no reallocation.
**Dynamic:** Size can grow/shrink, memory controlled, allocated/deallocated as needed.

**Advantages/Disadvantages:**
**Static:** + Fixed memory allocation, + Easier programming, - Inefficient use of memory.
**Dynamic:** + Efficient memory usage, - Risk of overflow/underflow, - Harder to program.
