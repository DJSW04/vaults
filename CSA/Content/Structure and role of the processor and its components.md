[[7. Computer Organisation and Architecture]]
# The processor and its components
---
- [ ] *Explain the role and operation of a processor and its major components:* 
	• arithmetic logic unit
	• control unit 
	• clock 
	• general-purpose registers 
	• **dedicated registers, including:** 
		• program counter 
		• current instruction register 
		• memory address register 
		• memory buffer register 
		• status register.

# The Fetch-Execute cycle and the role of registers within it
---
- [ ] *Explain how the Fetch-Execute cycle is used to execute machine code programs including the stages in the cycle (fetch, decode, execute) and details of registers used.*
---
# The processor instruction set
---
- [ ] *Understand the term ‘processor instruction set’ and know that an instruction set is processor specific.*
- [ ] *Know that instructions consist of an opcode and one or more operands (value, memory address or register).*
---
# Addressing modes
---
- [ ] *Understand and apply immediate and direct addressing modes.*
---
# Machine-code/assembly language operations
---
- [ ] *Understand and apply the basic machine-code operations of:* 
	• load 
	• add 
	• subtract 
	• store 
	• branching (conditional and unconditional) 
	• compare 
	• logical bitwise operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) 
	• **logical** 
		• shift right 
		• shift left 
	• halt
- [ ] *Use the basic machine-code operations above when machine-code instructions are expressed in mnemonic form- assembly language, using immediate and direct addressing.*
---
# Interrupts
---
- [ ] *Describe the role of interrupts and interrupt service routines (ISRs); their effect on the Fetch-Execute cycle; and the need to save the volatile environment while the interrupt is being serviced.*
---
# Factors affecting processor performance
---
- [ ] *Explain the effect on processor performance of:* 
	• multiple cores
	• cache memory 
	• clock speed 
	• word length 
	• address bus width 
	• data bus width.
