[[Non-exam Assessment]] 

**This section has a total of 9 achievable marks**

---
- [ ] *Fully or nearly fully scoped analysis of a real problem, presented in a way that a third party can understand.*
- [ ] *Requirements fully documented in a set of measurable and appropriate specific objectives, covering all required functionality of the solution or areas of investigation.*
- [ ] *Requirements arrived at by considering, through dialogue, the needs of the intended users of the system, or recipients of the outcomes for investigative projects.*
- [ ] *Problem sufficiently well modelled to be of use in subsequent stages.*
---

# Required Documentation
---
- [ ] a clear statement that describes the problem area and the specific problem being solved / investigated
- [ ] an outline of how the problem was researched
- [ ] a statement indicating who the problem is being solved / investigated for
- [ ] background in sufficient detail for a third party to understand the problem being solved / investigated
- [ ] a numbered list of measurable, "appropriate" specific objectives, covering all required functionality of the solution or areas of investigation (‘appropriate’ means the specific objectives are single purpose and at a level of detail that is without ambiguity)
- [ ] any modelling of the problem that will inform the Design stage, for example a graph/ network model of Facebook connections or an E-R model, state diagrams, scientific / mathematical models or formulae, data flow diagrams.

**Project: Cargo Loading System**

# The Problem
>Loading as much cargo into a container as possible in order to maximise profitability and minimise expense and increase loading safety.

This is best described to be a **[[Packing Problem]]**. Packing problems use optimisation to pack a storage container as densely as possible (maximising the cargo in the container while minimising the amount of left over space).

[[Packing Problem|Packing Problem Research]]

### Problem initial prototyping
For the initial prototype we will have the following constraints:
1. Container must be square / rectangular
2. Cargo must be square / rectangular
