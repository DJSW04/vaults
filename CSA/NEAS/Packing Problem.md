Packing problems use optimisation to pack a storage container as densely as possible (maximising the cargo in the container while minimising the amount of left over space). 

The **Packing Problem** is a well known problem in the field of mathematics.

For simplicity, the cargo will be rectangular/cubic.
For rectangular cargo, we know that it will give us three different rotations to work with.
