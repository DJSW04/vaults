## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
[6] Artificial Intelligence refers to the similarity of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and copy their steps. 

The specific type of artificial intelligence that deals with creativity/innovation is known as "Generative AI". So what exactly is Generative Artificial Intelligence? it is a Deep-Learning Model (which is a method of making machines learn to process data similar to that of the human brain) that can generate text, images and anything else that the model was trained on. There are however a great many different generative models. The one's I will focus on are Generative Adversarial Networks and Generative Pre-trained Transformers.

GANs are used to make digital art. GANs are made up of multiple neural networks ("deep learning algorithms which are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way biological neurons signal to one another." - ibm.com/topics/neural-networks) whichÂ  are used for deep learning to generate an output based on the input given by the user. While there are a few different types of GANs we can abstract and focus on the general way GANs work.

GPTs are an Auto-Regressive Model which is most commonly used for text generation (most notably chatGPT).
