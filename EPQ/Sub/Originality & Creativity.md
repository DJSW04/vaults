## [Originality](obsidian://open?vault=EPQ&file=1.%20Topics)
"If something is not novel and unique then it is commonplace and mundane, therefore cannot not original" $[1]$.

Originality is thought to be the pinnacle of creativity. it refers to the quality of being novel and unusual (Oxford University Press), with the work in question being not imitative of something else . However, it is also said that 'originality' is more of an amalgamation of pre-existing ideas rather than generation of something new entirely akin to inspiration. 


"It is better to fail in originality, than to succeed in imitation."
-Herman Melville, Hawthorne and His Mosses (1850)
