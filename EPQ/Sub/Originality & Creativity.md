# [Originality](obsidian://open?vault=EPQ&file=1.%20Topics)
"If something is not novel and unique then it is commonplace and mundane, therefore cannot be original" $[1]$.

Originality is thought to be the pinnacle of creativity, it refers to the quality of being novel and unusual (Oxford University Press), with the work in question being not imitative of something else and thus; without originality, there is no creativity. There are those who are in the same belief as Aristotle that; Originality is more of an amalgamation of pre-existing ideas rather than creation of something new.

It is said that the concepts of originality is entirely dependant on cultural beliefs, where blatant plagiarism may be viewed as veneration and therefore made acceptable, and imitations (or rather mimesis) of original works either viewed as "sordid theft" or a pleasant "adaptation" of the original.

Originality may not be a suitable measure of creativity.
