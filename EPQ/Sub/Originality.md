### Originality in humans
"If something is not novel and unique then it is commonplace and mundane, therefore cannot be original" $[1]$.

Originality is often regarded as the pinnacle of creativity. It refers to the quality of being novel and unusual (Oxford University Press), with the work in question not imitative of something else. Without originality, there is no creativity. Some share the belief of Aristotle; originality is more of an amalgamation of pre-existing ideas rather than the creation of something entirely new. Others believe that works are heavily influenced by experiences, making absolute originality very difficult to obtain.

It is argued that the concepts of originality are entirely dependent on cultural beliefs. Blatant plagiarism may be viewed as veneration and therefore made acceptable, while imitations (or mimesis) of original works might be seen as either "sordid theft" or a pleasant "adaptation" of the original.

"It is better to fail in originality, than to succeed in imitation."
-Herman Melville, Hawthorne and His Mosses (1850)

Similar to plagiarism, imitation not only has the potential to infringe on the intellectual property of others but can also stifle the development of original ideas entirely. Innovation is fuelled by the exploration of new, original ideas; without them, there is no innovation.
