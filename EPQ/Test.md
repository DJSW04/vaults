Is creative artwork produced by Artificial Intelligence truly original?

# Introduction

The remarkable rate of development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the past decade is astonishing. As technology continues to merge with creativity, I am intrigued by how AI influences our perception of arts and their originality. I aim to discover whether works produced by AI can truly compare to human creativity and originality through understanding philosophical, psychological, and neurophysiological definitions and comparing the neuroscience of creativity to generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Originality is often regarded as the pinnacle of creativity. It refers to the quality of “being new and interesting in a way that is different from anything that has existed before” (Originality - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, n.d.), with the work in question not imitative of something else. Without originality, there is no creativity. Some share the belief of Plato that all artistic creation is a form of imitation; originality is more of an amalgamation of pre-existing ideas rather than the creation of something entirely new. Others believe that works are heavily influenced by experiences, making absolute originality exceedingly difficult to obtain. It is argued that the concepts of originality are entirely dependent on cultural beliefs. Blatant plagiarism may be viewed as veneration and therefore made acceptable, while imitations (or mimesis) of original works might be seen as either ‘sordid theft’ or a pleasant ‘adaptation’ of the original. "It is better to fail in originality, than to succeed in imitation." (Melville, 1850)

|"Imitation: The result or product of imitating; a copy, an artificial likeness; a thing made to look like something else, which it is not; a counterfeit." (imitation (n.) , 2023)|

  
Similar to that of plagiarism, imitation not only has the potential to infringe on the intellectual property of others but can also stifle the development of original ideas in humans entirely. Innovation is fuelled by the exploration of new, original ideas; without them, there is no innovation.

# Artificial Intelligence

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence refers to “the similarity of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and copy their steps.” (Advantages And Disadvantages Of Artificial Intelligence, 2020)

The ‘branch’ of artificial intelligence that deals with creativity/innovation is known as ‘Generative AI.’ So, what exactly is Generative Artificial Intelligence? it is a Deep-Learning Model (which is a method of making machines learn to process data similar to that of the human brain) that can generate text, images, and anything else that the model was trained on. There are however a great many different generative models. The specific type I will focus on are Generative Adversarial Networks and Generative Pre-trained Transformers.

GANs are used to make digital art. GANs are made up of multiple neural networks. Neural networks are "deep learning algorithms which are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way biological neurons signal to one another." (Neural Networks, n.d.) which are used to generate an output based on the input given by the user. While there are quite a few different types of GANs we can abstract and focus on the general way GANs work.

GPTs are an Auto-Regressive Model which is most commonly used for text generation (most notably ChatGPT).
