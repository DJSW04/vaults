# Infix Transformations
---
- [ ] *Be able to convert simple expressions in infix form to Reverse Polish notation (RPN) form and vice versa.* 
- [ ] *Be aware of why and where it is used.*
---
## Importance of RPN
- Unambiguous, doesn't require brackets.
- Can be evaluated using stacks.
- In-order traversal gives infix.
- Post-order traversal gives a postfix.
